								<p class="justify">Our AME institute in Delhi is one of the reputed organization when it comes to placement. The cell for Placement has been built up in the institution to offer to the students a sense of direction and an exposure to the range of openings and job opportunities available to them as they pass out of the institute. The Cell will not limit itself to becoming the ‘placement’ center where students may just get connected with possible employers. The main goal of our cell includes the idea of preparing the student to become more confident and equip her/him with the ability to use their learning with the living of life.</p>
